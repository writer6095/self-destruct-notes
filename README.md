# 💣 Self-Destruct Note

A simple and secure web application that allows users to create one-time readable messages that automatically delete after being viewed. Perfect for sharing sensitive data or temporary notes with privacy in mind.

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 Create a self-destruct note with a custom message
- 🔐 Unique URL generated for each note
- 👁️‍🗨️ Note auto-deletes after first view
- 📦 Lightweight and minimal UI
- ☁️ Built with [your stack here, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript / Node.js / Python Flask]

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User types a message and clicks "Generate Note"
2. A unique, one-time URL is created
3. When someone opens the URL:
   - The note is shown **only once**
   - Then it's **permanently deleted** from the server/database

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: [e.g., Node.js + Express / Python Flask]
- Database: [e.g., MongoDB / Firebase / In-memory]

🔒 Security Notes
One-time view notes are permanently removed from the database after being accessed.

Consider using encryption for sensitive messages in a production version.

✨ Future Improvements
End-to-end encryption

Expiration timers (e.g., delete after 10 minutes)

User authentication for managing notes

QR code generation for sharing links easily
